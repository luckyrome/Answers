isHappy was an interview question I received and it seemed fairly straight forward.

Essentially there is a function which takes in an integer value, separates the values digits,
squares the digits then sums them together. If the sum is 1, the function returns true. Otherwise,
the function tries again with the new sum. If the sequence repeats at all, it will repeat forever
because of the deterministic nature of the operations.

Because this question was centered around squaring and summing numbers up, I stayed in math-mode
and tried to do some fancy math to split the digits. Unfortunately during interviews it's hard to
realize very simple mistakes (and I was trying to rush. A definite no-no when dealing with math).
Luckily the string-split method (where you stringify a number then split it) was super easy, but I 
wish I could've gotten the number-crunching method down too. 

Contained in this folder is the number crunching method that I meant to fire out, but I'd gotten
confused early on. See the source for an example of what the process looks like :)

Also note that part of the spec was to assume sane inputs (numbers greater than one), hence lack of 
checks in this particular problem
