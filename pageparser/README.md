pageparser - An HTML Parser
==================================================

## Synopsis

This app will allow a user to grab a document from around the internet and see its stats in regards to the HTML tags it has, and see a marked-up version

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to test how I write applications. Apparently :3 (aka I was asked to write this)

## Installation

Requirements: 
- node + npm installed for your user

run `npm install` to install dependencies then run `sudo npm run-script start` to start the server. Go to http://localhost:3000 (one day to be configurable) and you're set
At the moment the port for this is 3000 so you will have to start the server using sudo as in the example above

## Tests

`npm run-script test` for unit/integration tests
`npm run-script codestyle` for jshint
`npm run-script verify` for the whole thing
